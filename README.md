# WHMFcvphi_SSBcvphi
Calculate the EqSim uncertainties for WHM

EqSim requires information on the performance of the history of the assessment with respect to F and,
optionally SSB. The methodology is described in the WKMSYREF3 report. A comparison is made between the 
most recent assessment and the predicted F/SSB from historic forecasts.
